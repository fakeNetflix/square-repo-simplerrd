  class Def < Command
    #  DEF:<vname>=<rrdfile>:<ds-name>:<CF>[:step=<step>][:start=<time>][:end=<time>][:reduce=<CF>]
    #
    #  This command fetches data from an RRD file.  The virtual name vname can
    #  then be used throughout the rest of the script. By default, an RRA
    #  which contains the correct consolidated data at an appropriate
    #  resolution will be chosen.  The resolution can be overridden with the
    #  --step option.  The resolution can again be overridden by specifying
    #  the step size.  The time span of this data is the same as for the graph
    #  by default, you can override this by specifying start and end.
    #  Remember to escape colons in the time specification! 
    #
    #  If the resolution of the data is higher than the resolution of the
    #  graph, the data will be further consolidated. This may result in a
    #  graph that spans slightly more time than requested.  Ideally each point
    #  in the graph should correspond with one CDP from an RRA.  For instance,
    #  if your RRD has an RRA with a resolution of 1800 seconds per CDP, you
    #  should create an image with width 400 and time span 400*1800 seconds
    #  (use appropriate start and end times, such as "--start
    #  end-8days8hours").
    #
    #  If consolidation needs to be done, the CF of the RRA specified in the
    #  DEF itself will be used to reduce the data density. This behaviour can
    #  be changed using ":reduce=<CF>".  This optional parameter specifies the
    #  CF to use during the data reduction phase.
    #
    #  Example:
    #
    #    DEF:ds0=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE
    #    DEF:ds0weekly=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE:step=7200
    #    DEF:ds0weekly=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE:start=end-1h
    #    DEF:ds0weekly=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE:start=11\:00:end=start+1h
